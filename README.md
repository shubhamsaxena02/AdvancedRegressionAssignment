## General Information
- Aim of the project was to build an Advanced Linear Regression model for the prediction of Australian House prices
- Dataset for Australian Houses with their details and prices was provided

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Linear Regression overfits the model on train set and performs very poorly on test set.
- Ridge and Lasso regression both perform well on train and test set.
- Ridge Regression performs the best on test set with r2_score of .882 on train set and .871 on test set.

## Technologies Used
- python - Anaconda Jupyter notebook, seaborn library for plotting

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Acknowledgements
